      <h1>Favorite Foods</h1>
      <p>Here I have listed several of my favorite foods, as well as why I like them, & whether they're apetizers, entrees, desserts, or snacks.
      <div class="pizza">
        <h2>Pizza</h2>
        <h3><i>entree</i></h3>

        <p>Bread & cheese are some of my favorite kinds of foods, & they go pretty well together, & when you add toppings, especialy spicy ones the flavor is completed in a way that's hard to describe.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="pasta">
        <h2>Pasta</h2>
        <h3><i>entree</i></h3>

        <p>Pasta is an incredibly basic but reasonably tasty food that is very versatile as it goes well with most other foods. Personally salt, pepper, cheese, & butter are among my favorite things to put on pasta. It's pretty hard to pick just one type of pasta but if I had to angel hair spaghetti, the texture is immaculate</p>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div class="pickle">
        <h2>Pickles</h2>
        <h3><i>snack</i></h3>

        <p>Look I promise they don't all start with P. But yeah, I quite enjoy pickles, they may not be your thing but I like the sour taste, & spicy ones are pretty good too. & some will find this gross but I like the pickle juice too</p>
      </div>

      <div class="chili">
        <h2>Chili</h2>
        <h3><i>entree</i></h3>
        <img src=https://thebakermama.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/fullsizeoutput_f6f6.jpg width=100 height=100>
        <p>When not laced with whatever that sweet sauce is it's basically hamburgers but instead of a couple of hamburgers it's a bunch of hamburger. & spicy. Yum.</p>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div class="ice">
        <h2>Italian Ice</h2>
        <h3><i>dessert</i></h3>

        <p>It was pretty tough to pick between ice cream, gelato, sorbet, & italian ice but I decided on italian ice for reasons I can't really explain.</p>
